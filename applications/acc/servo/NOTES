In this directory I will change servo to be something like the final
form.  It will run in the background and communicate only through
shared memory and reflective memory.  For the moment reflective
memory will just be another shared memory block.

There will be two (compiler option) versions of servo:

1) Dummy open loop with no interaction with any hardware.
2) Antenna which runs both antenna axes.

Servo will be able to collect data in any mode.  It will go into a
rotary buffer capible of holding at least 1 sec's worth of data.  For the
moment it will be in the fake reflective memory.

Dmytrack will either run from a script or interactively and will control
servo through the "trackservo" shared memory segment.
